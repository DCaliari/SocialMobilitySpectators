{{ block content }}
<p>You will be asked to choose between two social mobility structures. The interpretation is as follows. </p>
<p>The childâ€™s status is represented by the colored boxes, the parent's status by the colored balls. </p>
<p>For instance, below the choice on the left implies that every child that has a high-status parent will also be high-status, the same is true for the low-status.</p>
<p>The choice on the right implies that one child with high-status parents will be high-status, one will be low-status; and one child with low-status parents will be low-status and one will be high-status.</p>
