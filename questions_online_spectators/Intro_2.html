        <p>In the <b>MAIN TASK</b>, you will be answering questions on how to assign the 2 dollars bonus. The task is as follows</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
            <li>You are paired with other <b>FOUR</b> participants. These four participants are part of a <b>society</b>.
                Importantly, <b>each society consists of two high and two low performers</b>.</li>
            <!--<li>Importantly, <b>each society consists of two high and two low performers</b>.</li>
            <li>In each society, only <b>two members will obtain the bonus.</b></li>
            <li>Bonuses will be <b>initially assigned randomly</b> to two of the members, <b> one to a high performer
            and one to a low performer.</b> So, the initial assignment tells you nothing about your performance.</li> -->
            <li>In each society, only <b>two members will obtain the bonus.</b></li>
            <li>Bonuses will be <b>initially assigned</b> as follows: participants are ranked by their performance, however,
            two out of four participants are randomly drawn and <b>their performance is inflated by 20 screens,</b> making the
            task performance irrelevant.</li>
            <li>Then, participants are re-ranked and the top two receive the initial bonus.</li>
            <li>The extra 20 screens are assigned randomly, so the initial allocation tells you nothing about their performance.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>Your task is to decide how you want to allocate the bonuses by choosing between alternative options.</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">HOW BONUSES ARE DETERMINED:</p>
        <p>One participant for each society is randomly selected and <b> one of his/her choices is implemented for everyone in the society!</b></p>
       <!-- <p>The participant is selected among the four members of a society you are part of plus a group of <span style="color: red">1</span> other participant who answers the same questions you will see but is not a member of the society.</p>
        <p>These other participants serve as control. You can ignore their existence and only remember that your choices may impact your payoffs and the payoffs of the other members of the society.</p> -->
        <p>The participant is selected among the four members of the society you are paired with and yourself.</p>
        <p>So, with probability 20%, your choices will impact the payoffs of the four members of the society.</p>
        <p><b>Your final payoff is fixed and does not depend on your choices.</b></p>
        <p>The final payoffs of the members of the society depend only on their final bonus.</p>
