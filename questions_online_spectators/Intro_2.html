<b>MAIN TASK</b>

{{ block content }}
        <p>In the <b>MAIN TASK</b>, you will answer four questions in which you will decide whether
            to keep or to re-assign an initial 2 dollars bonus allocation.</p>
        <p>You are paired with other <b>FOUR</b> participants.</p>
        <p>The initial bonus is assigned as follows. Consider participants as children. Each participant
            is paired with an individual (the parent) who has performed the effort task in a separate experiment. If the
            parent was a high performer then the participant receives the initial bonus of 2 dollars, if the parent was
            a low performer she does not receive the initial bonus. Therefore, the initial bonus reflects the status that
            participants inherit from the effort exerted by her parent.</p>
        <p><b>THE SOCIETY:</b></p>
        <ol style="padding: 0; margin: 0;">
            <li>The FOUR participants (the children) are a <b>society</b>.
            <li>In each society, two participants receive the initial bonus and two do not.</li>
            <li>In each society, two participants are high performers, and two are low performers.</li>
            <!--<li>Importantly, <b>each society consists of two high and two low performers</b>.</li>
            <li>In each society, only <b>two members will obtain the bonus.</b></li>
            <li>Bonuses will be <b>initially assigned randomly</b> to two of the members, <b> one to a high performer
            and one to a low performer.</b> So, the initial assignment tells you nothing about your performance.</li> -->
            <li>To make sure that the effort of parents and children is unrelated, in every society, the initial bonus is distributed such that
                one high- and one low performer receive the bonus, while one high- and one low-performer do not (see Figure below).
            <li>This aspect reflects the fact that, in the experiment, participants (the children) "born" from high and low performer parents
                are equally likely to exert low and high effort.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p><b>THE MAIN TASK:</b></p>
        <ol style="padding: 0; margin: 0;">
            <li>Your task is to decide whether to keep or to re-assign the initial bonus assignments.</li>
            <li>Important, your choice is not about redistribution of money <b>but redistribution of odds.</b> To clarify,
                in each society, two participants will obtain the final bonus and two will not regardless of your choice which
                only impacts the odds that participants will receive the bonus. These odds will be precisely specified in
                each question.</li>

        <p>These other participants serve as control. You can ignore their existence and only remember that your choices may impact your payoffs and the payoffs of the other members of the society.</p> -->
        <p>The participant is selected among the four members of the society you are paired with and yourself.</p>
        <p>So, with probability 20%, your choices will impact the payoffs of the four members of the society.</p>
        <p><b>Your final payoff is fixed and does not depend on your choices.</b></p>
        <p>The final payoffs of the members of the society depend only on their final bonus.</p>
