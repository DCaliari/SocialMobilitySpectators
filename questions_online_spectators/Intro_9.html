        <p>One participant for each society is randomly selected and <b> one of his/her choices is implemented!</b></p>
        <p>The participant is selected among the four members of the society you are paired with and yourself.</p>
        <p>So, with probability 20%, your choices will impact the payoffs of the four members of the society.</p>
        <p><b>Only the child’s status is important for the final payoff.</b> High-status children receives 1.5 pounds and Low-status receives 0 pounds.</p>        <p>The probability that each member will have a certain child’s status depends on the parent’s status and the selected social mobility structure.</p>
        <p>Children’s status depends on the parent’s status and the selected social mobility structure.</p>
        <p><b>Important:</b> there will be the same number of high and low status parents and children independently from your choices. This is true for the entire experiment. <b>Your choice will only modify the probability that each member will receive a certain child’s status.</b></p>
