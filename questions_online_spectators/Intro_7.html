            <p>The parents of each of the four members of the society have status: high (<span style="color: green">green</span>) or low (<span style="color: red">red</span>).</p>
            <p>There are four colored balls with a different number of stars representing the members of the society.</p>
            <p>The stars represent the results in the task you have previously performed. <b>“Two stars”</b> indicate that the member is in the top half of the results in the task, <b>“one star”</b> indicate that the member is in the bottom half.</p>
            <p>For each parent’s status there is always one <b>“two stars”</b> and one <b>“one star”</b> ball.
            <p>This means that the parent’s status does not give you any information regarding yours and others’ results in the task.</p>
