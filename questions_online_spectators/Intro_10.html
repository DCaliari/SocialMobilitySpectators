<p>To facilitate the understanding of the payment structure: <b>the pies that you will see on each screen are comprehensive of all you need to know about the incentives in this experiment</b></p>
<p>For example, the social mobility structure on the left (<b>No Mobility</b>) assigns to the children the same status of their parents. </p>
<p>The one on the right (<b>Full Mobility</b>) allows for social mobility with one child whose parents are low status become high status. <b>Since inequality is society is fixed,</b> one child whose parents are high status become low status.</p>
