<p>This study consists of an <b>EFFORT TASK</b> followed by the <b>MAIN TASK</b> which instructions will follow.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">EFFORT TASK:</p>
<br>
<p>The <b>EFFORT TASK</b> is a contest among all participants and simulates the role of effort in real life (e.g. what
    individuals achieve through their own actions). The <b>EFFORT TASK</b> serves the purpose of dividing
participants into <b>high performers</b> and <b>low performers</b>.</p>
<p>The contest works as follows:</p>
<p>You will see a series of screens with two 10x10 matrices of two-digits numbers.</p>
<p>Your task is to find the maximum number in the first and the second matrix, sum them, and write the answer in the box below the matrices <b>[see an example below]</b>.</p>
<p>You are allowed to continue to the next set of matrices only if you give the correct answer.</p>
<p>The task will last 3 minutes and the objective is to complete as many screens as possible.</p>
<p>At the end of the task, all participants will be ranked according to their performance. The top 50% will be
assigned to the <b>high performers</b>, and the bottom 50% will be assigned to the <b>low performers</b>.</p>
<p>Being high- or low-performers will play a role in the <b>MAIN TASK</b>.</p>
<p>Clicking “CONTINUE” you will start the task.</p>
